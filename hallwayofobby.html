							<p>Way back when I started on roblox, I, like many other young people, decide to play one of the tower obbys. I enjoyed it, and wanted to make my own. I got my friends to help me and together we made Tower Of Obby. I was never able to advertise it well due to not having money, but it ended up being my first big success because it was my first working real game.</p>
							<p>I was the sole scripter in the project. I also made a couple stages. Since this was my first real project in which I challenged myself to not use any outside resources, I was able to learn a lot about scripting on Roblox. I was able to learn how things interact with eachother and some other basic principles about making games.</p>
