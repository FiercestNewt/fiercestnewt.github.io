							<p>As a child I loved the game Minecraft. I played it almost every day. When the elytra was added to the game, I thought that It was the cooles thing ever. I have since decided to make a racing game out of that function. It is not finished, but I have spent many hours making it work and feel fun.</p>
							<p>I had a lot of trouble making the gliding system work. I started the project back in 2021, and gut too stumped on the flight mechaninc, and gave up. I have since returned and figured it out. I also wrote what I think is a pretty good UI system using Roact. I hope to one day finish this game up and make a fun and enjoyable expirience for players on Roblox!</p>
